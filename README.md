# DS Starter Kit

A toolkit for building and documenting design systems built with Web Components.

## What's it do?

DS Starter Kit is designed to bootstrap the development of a design system or
component library that's built upon [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

### Documentation Powered by Docsify

This documentation site is powered by [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), a
lightweight documentation site generator with no statically generated HTML files.
It allows all documentation to be written in Markdown.

DS Starter Kit includes a custom theme for Docsify, plus a suite of custom
plugins that enable robust documentation of Web Components. This includes
resizable component previews with source code rendering and automatic
documentation of the component API.

Unlike heavyweight tools such as Storybook, DS Starter Kit's documentation
implementation is specifically tuned for documenting and developing Web
Components. It boots instantly in development, integrates seamlessly with
existing component build processes, and allows for high levels of customization.

### Development Stack

This project combines the following technologies for rapidly building,
documenting, and testing Web Components:

- [Lit](https://lit.dev/) for simple and fast Web Components.
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for blazing fast bundling.
- [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) for unit testing.
- [Percy](https://percy.io/) for visual testing.
- [Custom Elements Manifest Analyzer](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/getting-started/) for automatic documentation of class members.
- [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) for quickly spinning up new components.

## Who's it for?

DS Starter Kit is designed for organizations that are looking to create their
own bespoke component library or design system that uses Web Components. It
includes everything you need to get hit the ground running including a complete
toolchain to write, test, and build Web Components plus an optimized
documentation framework to ease development and encourage adoption across your
organization.
